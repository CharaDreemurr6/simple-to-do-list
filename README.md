# simple-to-do-list
this is my first project in python, yes it is exactly whatÂ´s in the name.
# plans
- add a .json file for permanent saving (it will be saved permanently with the changes unless the user erases it)
- a gui made in html, css and js (a frontend for you dev people)
- continous integration (yes, i know CI for a simple to do list is stupid, but im gonna integrate it anyways)
